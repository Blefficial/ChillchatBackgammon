## Controls

This game features a simple drag-and-drop gameplay mechanic. To move pieces, click on the desired piece, keep the mouse pressed and let go once over the target location.

Controls can also be viewed via the in-game menu.

## Rules

Rules are per the classic Backgammon rules, with the exception of *higher number precedence* (where if a move can be made according to either one die, bu not both, the higher number must be played). The doubling cuve is also not included.

Before each game, players must choose a stake amount they are willing to play. Once the game has finished, staked amount will be subtracted from the loser and added to the winners total points.

As per classic Backgammon rules, different win conditions may multiply the stake amount before being added or subtracted from the players. This means the players may lose or gain more depending how the game is won.

### Multipliers

Gammon = stake * 2
Backgammon = stake * 3
